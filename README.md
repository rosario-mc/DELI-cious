# DELI-cious - Sandwich Shop POS System

## Project Overview

**DELI-cious** is a point-of-sale (POS) application designed for a customizable sandwich shop. As the business grows, this application replaces the manual, paper-based order process with an automated, object-oriented software solution. The goal is to streamline the order process and eventually prepare the business for online order support.

This is a capstone project that demonstrates core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles including class design, interfaces, encapsulation, and inheritance.
